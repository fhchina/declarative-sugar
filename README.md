# DeclarativeSugar

a Flutter-like declarative UI syntax sugar  base on Swift and UIStackView

## Feature

![](/1.png)

- [x] Declarative UI
- [x] Hide UIStackView complexity, use Flutter-ish API instead
- [x] Support composable view-hierachy as same as UIStackView
- [x] Support "Full Rebuild" and "Incremental Update"
- [x] Support Animation except "Full Rebuild"

## Depolyment & Dependency

iOS 9, UIKit

But I would like to recommend [Then](https://github.com/devxoul/Then) to write more concise UI setup code

## Usage

### 1. inherite `DeclarativeViewController`

``` swift
class ViewController: DeclarativeViewController {
...
```

### 2. provide your own view-hierachy

``` swift
override func build() -> DZStack {
    return DZColumn(
            crossAxisAlignment: .leading,
            children: [
                DZRow(
                    crossAxisAlignment: .bottom,
                    children: [
                        UILabel().then { $0.text = "hello world"; $0.isHidden = self.hide },
                        UIView().then {
                            $0.backgroundColor = .red
                            $0.snp.makeConstraints { make in
                                make.size.equalTo(CGSize(width: 50, height: 100))
                            }
                        },
                        DZSpacer(40),
                        UIView().then {
                            $0.backgroundColor = .blue
                            $0.snp.makeConstraints { make in
                                make.size.equalTo(CGSize(width: 50, height: 50))
                            }
                        },
                    ]),
                DZSpacer(self.hide ? 10 : 50),
                UIView().then {
                    $0.backgroundColor = .orange
                    $0.snp.makeConstraints { make in
                        make.size.equalTo(CGSize(width: 50, height: 50))
                    }
                },
                DZSpacer(10),
                UILabel().then {
                    $0.numberOfLines = 0
                    $0.text =
                    """

                },
            ])
            .then {
                view.addSubview($0)
                $0.snp.makeConstraints {
                    $0.top.equalToSuperview().offset(300)
                    $0.left.right.equalToSuperview()
                }
        }
}
```

### 3. Update state (full rebuild without animation)

``` swift
override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {
        self.rebuild {
            self.hide = !self.hide
        }
    }
```

### 4. Update state (incremental with animation)

note: first of all, abstract target controls to local variables

``` swift
override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {
        UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5) {
            // incremental reload
            self.hide = !self.hide
            self.context.setSpacing(self.hide ? 50 : 10, for: self.spacer)
            self.context.setHidden(self.hide, for: self.label)
        }
    }
```
